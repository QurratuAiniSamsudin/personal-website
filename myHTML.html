<h1 style="color:olive">My Experiance During MCO Period</h1>
<p>Since the Covid-19 restricted movement in place, everyone have to stay at home instead of going out to minimise their risk of contracting Covide-19. There are many fun activities that I and my family do during MCO period, this can strengthen the family bond and also I can spend my time with family.</p>

<ul>
	<li style="color:green">Learn Farming</li>
<p>I spend my time with trying to farming. I put my creativiy and effort, to plant flowers in my mother garden. Before I try to farming I surf the internet and watch videos on Youtube for simple tips on how to greens the garden with the flowers. Through this process, I can learn about the ecosystem and types of flowers.</p><a href="http://www.Youtube.com">Go to Youtube</a>  

    <li style="color:green">Learn to Cook With My Mother</li>
<p>The MCO period gives me the oppurtunity for me to learn cooking from my mother, my mother teach me to cook my favourite dish and I also start to learning the baking skills from her.</p>

    <li style="color:green">DIY Project</li>
<p>Instead of scrolling my Instagram, I also surfing the internet for some cool DIY arts and crafts. On Google, Facebook and Instagram I can learn a string of different types of arts and craft ideas. Example turning cereal boxes into file organisers and homemade boxes using recycled magazine paper. The best bit is these projects are simple and also can help to screcth our ringgit further.</p>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least take care of yourself and remember please follow the rules that have made by government for our good.</p>
